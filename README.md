# Class-Registration-System
## Overview of the project
This is a program written in java which uses the Model-View-Control design pattern. It takes in a tab seperated value file and creates different class objects out of the information given. This file is included in the repository and is titled `project1input.csv`. It then split the cells in the file on the tab character and adds those values to an array list depending on what they are.
